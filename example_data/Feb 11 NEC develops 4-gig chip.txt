NEC  says  it  has  developed  the  world's  largest-capacity  memory  device,  a  four-gigabit  dynamic  random  access 
memory (dram) chip, which has 128 times the memory capacity of the 32-megabit drams now widely used in PCs.
NEC says the four-gigabit chip, which has about the capacity of a CD-rom, uses new technology, making it half the 
size of a conventional microchip at one-tenth the cost.
The chip uses four-level storage, allowing the memory cell to function as a multi-bit unit, effectively halving the cell 
size. NEC says the chip achieves a high data transfer speed of one-gigabit per second.
Sample shipments are expected to begin in 2000, with production planned from 2002 or 2003.
The company has not disclosed the expected price for the chip, but notes it will not be extraordinarily high.
Meanwhile,  a  team  of  international  scientists  has  discovered  a  new  phenomenon  that  may  pave  the  way  for  the 
development of immensely dense computer memory and quantum computing.
The  heart  of  the  team's  discovery  is  the  behaviour  of  a  magnet  one  molecule  in  size,  created  from  a  special 
combination of manganese, oxygen, carbon, and hydrogen. If scientists can devise a technology to read and write 
from  the  tiny  magnet,  it  will  create  the  basis  for  a  data  storage  unit  one  molecule  in  size.  Currently,  magnetic 
storage units require billions of molecules each.
The  material  used  for  these  experiments  is  a  crystalline  substance  found  in  ordinary  vinegar.  Using  molecular 
magnets, it is theoretically possible to store hundreds of gigabytes of data in an area no larger than the head of a 
pin.
The  findings  may  also  be  the  first  practical  step  in  the  development  of  a  new  breed  of  supercomputer  called  a 
quantum  computer,  which  would  process  calculations  at  enormous  speeds  and  in  a  manner  much  like  the 
complicated processing functions in the human brain.
While the possibility of quantum computing has only been proven mathematically, a key factor in the creation of 
such  a  device  would  be  a  material  that  demonstrates  the  phenomenon  of  quantum  superposition,  where  each 
memory  unit  in  a  quantum  computer  represents  a  yes''  and  a  no''  state  simultaneously.  By  applying  strong 
magnetic fields, the team observed the ability to control the quantum mechanical tunnelling rate between the yes'' 
and no'' states.
