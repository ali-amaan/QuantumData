In the last half-century, transistors have increased millions of times in power -- but that's not good enough.
Manufacturers  are  developing  ways  to  manufacture  chips  with  transistors  so  minuscule,  so  delicate,  that  present 
methods will seem as crude as cutting a diamond with a chain saw.
Nowadays,  microelectronics  engineers  manufacture  chips  via  optical  lithography.  In  this  technique  --  akin  to 
photography  --  images  of  different  parts  of  the  chip  are  projected  onto  a  special  plate.  The  plate  is  bathed  in 
chemicals  and  developed,  like  a  negative  in  a  photo  lab.  Modern  chips  have  several  layers,  like  multi-storey 
buildings.

Chips are getting so small that their individual components are smaller than the wavelength of visible light, so sub-
optical lithography is needed.
Some  scientists  are  investigating  forms  of  lithography  that  cut  a  super-fine  microchip  with  beams  of  electrons. 
Others  are  developing  lithography  that  uses  radiation  at  X-ray  and  extreme  ultraviolet  wavelengths,  which  are 
shorter than those of visible light.
By  about  2002  or  2003,  scientists  at  Bell  Laboratories/Lucent  Technologies  expect  to  shrink  chip  components  to 
about 0.13 microns. A micron is a millionth of a metre.
At  0.13  micron,  optical  lithography  "just  gets  harder  and  harder,"  says  William  Brinkman,  the  company's  vice-
president  of  physical  sciences  research.  At  that  point,  Lucent  will  have  to  shift  to  electron-beam  lithography  -- 
assuming it works.
And if it doesn't? "We'll be stuck," Brinkman admits. "This is a thing that has to happen."
Another problem arises as transistors shrink to atomic scale. At that level, the weird world of quantum physics starts 
to  take  over:  The  movement  of  electrons  becomes  much  harder  to  predict,  and  is  governed  by  principles  of 
statistics rather than the neat, clean exactitudes of Newtonian physics.
Some fear that chips with components comparable in size to atoms could be hopelessly unreliable.
But  quantum  effects  may  be  an  opportunity,  not  a  barrier.  Quantum  computers  could  be  stunningly  faster  than 
anything currently available.

Some  scientific  problems  are  so  complex  that  no  existing  computer  can  crunch  the  necessary  numbers  in  a 
reasonable time. In some cases, the computer would require a period of time equal, in seconds, to the numeral 1 
followed by 40 zeros, says Stanley Williams of Hewlett-Packard in Palo Alto, Calif.
The present age of the universe in seconds is believed to be the numeral 1 followed by 17 zeros.
Quantum computing already exists, in rudimentary form.
"Exactly a year ago, if I had been asked how long it would be before the simplest quantum computation could be 
done, I'd have said 10 years," says Williams, who runs Hewlett-Packard's Quantum Structures Research Initiative. 
"And now, it has already been done at UC-Berkeley, Oxford, Los Alamos, in actual experiments."
One  type  of  quantum  computer  might  store  information  in  hydrogen  atoms,  the  lightest  element.  Ordinarily,  a 
single  electron  orbits  an  hydrogen  atom.  By  firing  a  micro-laser  at  the  atom,  the  electron  can  be  switched  from  a 
high orbit to a low orbit, back and forth, like flicking a light switch on and off. To the quantum computer, the low-
orbit electron would represent "0" and the high-orbit electron would be "1." In this way the computer could calculate 
using the same binary code -- long strings of 0s and 1s that symbolize data -- now used by computers.
Intel co-founder Gordon Moore is more skeptical.
"Maybe I've been in this business too long," he acknowledges, "but from what I've seen of quantum computing, it 
looks  to  me  more  like  a  way  to  show  some  of  the  counter-intuitive  effects  of  quantum  mechanics  than  a  practical 
route to making a useful device."
Still, Moore adds with a laugh, "Predicting something won't work is one of the most dangerous things to do in this 
business."
